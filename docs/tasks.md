# Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Implement a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns (controllers, services, repositories)
2. [ ] Create a service layer between controllers and repositories to encapsulate business logic
3. [ ] Implement a DTO pattern to separate entity models from API models
4. [ ] Standardize error handling across the application with a global exception handler
5. [ ] Implement API versioning strategy for better backward compatibility
6. [ ] Improve caching strategy with more granular cache configurations and eviction policies
7. [ ] Implement a comprehensive logging strategy with structured logging
8. [ ] Create a modular architecture by grouping related functionality into modules
9. [ ] Implement a feature toggle system for easier feature deployment and rollback
10. [ ] Improve security by implementing proper CSRF protection and security headers

## Code Quality Improvements

11. [ ] Remove duplicate timing annotations (@Timed and @TimedMethod) in controllers
12. [ ] Replace hardcoded values (like user IDs and logins) with configuration properties
13. [ ] Implement proper exception handling in controllers instead of propagating exceptions
14. [ ] Add input validation for all controller endpoints
15. [ ] Optimize database queries by using projections and pagination where appropriate
16. [ ] Improve transaction management by using appropriate isolation levels
17. [ ] Refactor User entity to include proper account status management
18. [ ] Change eager loading of roles to lazy loading with appropriate fetch strategies
19. [ ] Add missing getters/setters for entity fields
20. [ ] Implement builder pattern for complex object creation
21. [ ] Refactor TimeLoggingFilter to handle exceptions during filter chain execution
22. [ ] Improve security of logging by masking sensitive information in logs
23. [ ] Optimize string concatenation in log messages

## Testing Improvements

24. [ ] Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
25. [ ] Implement integration tests for all REST endpoints
26. [ ] Add parameterized tests to reduce test code duplication
27. [ ] Implement test fixtures for common test data
28. [ ] Add performance tests for critical paths
29. [ ] Implement contract tests for external dependencies
30. [ ] Add mutation testing to improve test quality
